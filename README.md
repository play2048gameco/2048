   https://play2048gameco.github.io/2048/

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles.
- When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values.
- The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.
- The game ends when there are no more possible moves.


## Basic Rules
- Grid and Tiles: The game is played on a 4x4 grid with numbered tiles. Each tile is a power of two.
- Starting Position: The game starts with two tiles placed randomly on the grid, either a 2 or a 4.
- Moves: You can move all tiles in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. When you move the tiles, all tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they hit the edge of the grid or another tile.
- Combining Tiles: When two tiles with the same number collide during a move, they merge into a tile with the total of their numbers (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4). The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move.
- Winning: The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.
- Losing: The game ends when there are no empty spaces on the grid and no more moves are possible.

## Strategies
- Keep the Highest Tile in a Corner: Try to keep your highest-value tile in one of the corners and build around it. This helps to manage the board and create opportunities for combining tiles.
- Build Up in Rows and Columns: Work on creating high-value tiles by combining smaller tiles in rows or columns. This can help in managing space and creating bigger tiles.
- Avoid Filling Up the Board: Try not to let the board fill up with tiles, as this reduces the number of possible moves and can lead to a game over.
- Plan Ahead: Think about the consequences of your moves. Plan a few moves ahead to avoid blocking tiles or creating an unmanageable board state.
- Stay Flexible: While it's good to have a general strategy, stay flexible and adapt to the tiles and moves available.
